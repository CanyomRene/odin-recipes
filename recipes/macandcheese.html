    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>16 ounces uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
      <li>2 ½ cups milk</li>
      <li>2 cups water</li>
      <li>2 cloves of Garlic</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¼ cup butter</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups shredded white Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>½ cup shredded Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
      <li>¼ cup panko bread crumbs</li>
      <li>¼ cup real bacon bits</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon snipped chives</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> 
      Combine macaroni, milk, water, garlic salt, and salt in a Dutch oven on a stovetop over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook, stirring frequently so noodles don't stick to the pan, until noodles are soft and most of the liquid has been absorbed, 7 to 10 minutes.   
    </p>
    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong>
      Remove pot from heat and stir in margarine and pepper until melted. Stir in Cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese until melted.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Step 3:</strong>
      Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Step 4</strong>
      Top pasta with bread crumbs, remaining 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese, and bacon bits.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Step 5</strong>
      Place Dutch oven under the broiler until topping is lightly browned and crispy, 1 to 3 minutes. Top with chives and serve immediately.
